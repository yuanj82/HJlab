## Description

We are trying to elucidate how plants, microorganis and the environment interact.

In our lab, plants and microorganisms have been employed for study the mechanism of how plants, microorganism and environment interact. Besides, yeast is also a good tool for study how plant gene function, as yeast cells share a lot features with plant cells. 

## Research Direction

>**Phytoremediation of Heavy Metal Polluted Soil and Its Mechanism**

From the perspectives of plant physiology, biochemistry, molecular biology, and genetics, this study investigates the absorption and transport mechanisms of heavy metals by plants in cadmium contaminated soil. This study aims to understand the absorption and transport of heavy metals in crops, providing a theoretical basis for breeding and food safety. Additionally, it provides important theoretical support for utilizing plants to absorb and transfer heavy metals in soil and achieve bioremediation.

>**Molecular Mechanism of the Joint Regulation of Environmental and Genetic Factors on the Development of Rice Root Hairs**

Taking rice as the research object, this study investigates how the root hairs, an important part of plants that absorb water and nutrients, are jointly regulated by environmental and genetic factors. This study is of great significance for understanding the development mechanism of plant root hairs, screening crops with drought resistance and high nutrient absorption efficiency, or plants for ecological management.

>**Research on Biological Treatment Technology and Mechanism of Sandy Soil**

In response to the prominent problem of grassland desertification in the northwest Sichuan region (Ruoergai), we have utilized grass seeds, microorganisms, fertilizers, plant hormones, and maintenance techniques to restore plant coverage and regional ecology in the sandy land. We have also conducted research on the function and application of stress resistant plant genes and the interaction mechanism between plants and soil microorganisms in the process of desertification control.
